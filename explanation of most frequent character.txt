Write a program that lets the user enter a string and displays the character 
that appears most frequently in the string.

line 7 = it is a count variable that lists 26 intergers

line 15 = it is a method that is converting ch to uppercase

line 18 = it takes character and finds it in the letter string and returns 
the number of the position in the letter string and assigns it to index.


line 22 = it is redefining the count at position index by taking 
the count at position index and adding 1 to it.

line 26 = it is assigning variable frequent to i which is the 
position with the greatest number in count.
